# HangmanPY V2


Hangman V2 is developed by me, Andrew Abercrombie. I got bored one day and realized my old version of this was trash. I have revamped how the code works to ensure more common programming practices are being utilized. You can check out the old version here: https://github.com/AndrewAbercrombie/HangmanPY


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndrewAbercrombie/HangmanPY-v2.git

python Hangman.py
```
